# data-science
Hi, i'm glad you're reading these lines.

You will find mainly functions that help to work more efficiently, and can be useful in professionnal or private data exploration.
I try to give as much explanation as possible for people who start with Python.

If you see things that could be improved, if you have any ideas for new homemade tools with Python, or if you want to share yours, I'll be happy to read you and visit your portofolio.

Until then, good reading and see you soon!
